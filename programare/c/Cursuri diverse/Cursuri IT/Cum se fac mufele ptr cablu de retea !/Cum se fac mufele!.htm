<H3>Wiring Tutorial for 10BaseT Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)</H3>
<P><FONT size=+1>O</FONT>ne of the most common and most puzzling problems a 
network engineer/technician may face is what is the PROPER way to make up a 
10BaseT cable. Usually, to confound the learning process, someone introduces the 
need for a <I>reversed or cross-over</I> cable at the same time. What these are 
and how to make them is the subject of this on-line tutorial. 
<P><B>Selection of Cabling Category</B> 
<P><FONT size=+1>S</FONT>ince the overwhelming bulk of network cabling done 
today uses Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) wiring that is what we will discuss. 
The process begins with the selection of the proper wiring level or category. 
Today it is basically inexcusable to use or install anything at less than 
<NOBR>Level V</NOBR> or <NOBR>Category 5</NOBR>. 
<P>While technically <I>Category 5</I> and <I>Level V</I> are not the same, they 
are identical in practice. Both support upto 100 megabit per second data 
transmission, and their physical cable assembly requirements are the same. 
Throughout this tutorial we will refer to them both as CAT5. 
<P>When you order CAT5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable you will receive a 
cable containing 4 twisted pairs of wires, a total of 8 wires. The strands that 
constitute each wire will either be a single strand or multiple strands, usually 
referred to as <I>solid</I> or <I>flex</I>. Typically the solid is used to run 
through walls and ceilings and the flex is used to make drop cables (the cable 
from the wall plate to the desktop computer) and patch cables (the cable from 
the patch panel to the hub). Whether the exterior portion of the cable that 
contains the 4 twisted pairs, the jacket, is <I>Plenum grade</I> or 
<I>Non-plenum grade</I> is very important, it refers to the Fire Codes, but is 
outside the scope of this tutorial. 
<P><B>Ordering Pairs</B> 
<P>The pairs of wires in UTP cable are colored so that you can identify the same 
wire at each end. Furthermore, they are usually color coded by pair so that the 
pairs can also be identified from end to end. Typical CAT5 UTP cables contain 4 
pairs made up of a solid color and the same solid color striped onto a white 
background. The most common color scheme is the one that corresponds to the 
Electronic Industry Association/Telecommunications Industry Association's 
Standard 568B. 
<P>The following table demonstrates the proper color scheme.

<P><B>Connectors</B> 
<P>The cable connectors and jacks that are most commonly used with CAT5 UTP 
cables are RJ45. The RJ simply means <I>Registered Jack</I> and the <I>45</I> 
designation specifies the pin numbering scheme. The connector is attached to the 
cable and the jack is the device that the connector plugs into, whether it is in 
the wall, the network interface card in the computer, or the hub. 
<P>
<P>Now that we are ready to insert the cable into the RJ45 plug the wire number 
and color sequence becomes more complicated.</P>
<P>The IEEE Specification for Ethernet 10BaseT requires that two twisted pairs 
be used and that one pair is connected to pins 1 and 2, and that the second pair 
is connected to pins 3 and 6. Yes that is right - pins 4 and 5 are skipped and 
are connected to one of the remaining twisted pairs. </P>
<P><I>According to the EIA/TIA-568B RJ-45 Wiring Scheme:</I></P>
<P>It gets even more odd because wire Pair#2 (white/orange, orange) and Pair#3 
(white/green, green) are the only two pairs used for 10BaseT data.</P>

<P>This is illustrated in the following diagram:

<P>Now the wires forming the pairs must be gathered together and trimmed so that 
they can be inserted into the RJ45 plug. The pairs gathered and trimmed is 
illustrated in the following diagram:

<CENTER><FONT size=+2>Crossover Cables</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<P>In order to make what is commonly referred to as a "Crossover" cable one must 
change the pinout connections on <B>ONE</B> end of the cable. If you do it on 
both ends of the cable you have crossed-over the crossover and now have a 
straight-through cable, albeit a very non-standard one. In this case two 
negatives do make a positive. 
<P>You need to make a cable where pins 1 &amp; 2 from one end are connected to 
pins 3 &amp; 6 on the other end, and pins 3 &amp; 6 from the first end are 
connected to pins 1 &amp; 2 on the other end. Pins 4 &amp; 5 and 7 &amp; 8 are 
unchanged. 
<P>
<P>
<P><PRE>The two ends look like this:

     Standard End                          Crossover End

       Pin 1 White/Orange                   Pin 1 White/Green

       Pin 2 Orange                         Pin 2 Green

       Pin 3 White/Green                    Pin 3 White/Orange

       Pin 4 Blue                           Pin 4 Blue

       Pin 5 White/Blue                     Pin 5 White/Blue

       Pin 6 Green                          Pin 6 Orange

       Pin 7 White/Brown                    Pin 7 White/Brown
 
       Pin 8 Brown                          Pin 8 Brown

<P>
<P>Note: Even though we are only interested in attaching the connectors to the 
cable in this tutorial, we must take into account the wiring of the jacks as 
well so that we connect the proper wires from the cable to the proper pins in 
the connectors. And that is determined by the wiring in the jack the connectors 
will be plugged into.
